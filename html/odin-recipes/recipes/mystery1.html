      <li>3 tbsp fine white breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>5 oz milk to soak</li>
      <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>1 red pepper, finely sliced</li>
      <li>1 oz dry white wine</li>
      <li>2 14oz cans chopped tomatoes</li>
      <li>Small bunch of basil</li>
      <li>1 tbsp chopped oregano</li>
      <li>Sea salt, freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 lb ground beef</li>
      <li>1/2 lb ground pork</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves, peeled and halved</li>
      <li>A bunch of Italian flat-leaf parsley</li>
      <li>2 tbsp freshly grated Italian Romano cheese (keep extra)</li>
      <li>Flour to dust meatballs before frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium sized bowl, add the breadcrumbs, pour in just enough milk to
        cover, and place aside to let breadcrumbs soak; preheat the oven to
        350°F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Start making the sauce by heating the 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a
        frying pan and lightly fry the chopped shallots, pepper, and garlic for
        2-3 minutes until translucent and soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the 2 14oz cans of tomatoes, basil, oregano, and some seasoning with
        a white wine splash to deglaze the pan. Let the tomato sauce slowly
        simmer for about 10-15 minutes so its sauce can reduce and thicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        As the sauce is simmering, make the meatballs. Place the ground pork and
        beef into a large-sized mixing bowl, and now the chopped garlic,
        Parmesan, and parsley. Now, press the breadcrumbs, remove the excess
        milk, and add them to the mixing bowl with ground meats. Thoroughly mix,
        working with your hands, then season meatballs with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Start shaping the blend into balls the size of a golf ball, and dust
        them with the flour. Now in a frying pan, heat the olive oil. When the
        oil is hot, fry the meatballs in batches of 4-5 not to overcrowd them;
        fry until golden.
      </li>
      <li>
        After drying, add the meatballs to the sauce and then shift them to a
        casserole dish. Place in a 350°F preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes.
        Serve with your favorite pasta as a side dish or a light salad.
